## Abstract

Embedded software is deployed in billions of devices worldwide, including in safety\-sensitive systems like medical devices and autonomous vehicles\. Defects in embedded software can have severe consequences\. Many embedded software products incorporate Open\-Source Embedded Software \(EMBOSS\), so it is important for EMBOSS engineers to use appropriate mechanisms to avoid defects\. One of the common security practices is to use Static Application Security Testing \(SAST\) tools, which help identify commonly occurring vulnerabilities\. Existing research related to SAST tools focuses mainly on regular \(or non\-embedded\) software\. There is a lack of knowledge about the use of SAST tools in embedded software\. Furthermore, embedded software greatly differs from regular software in terms of semantics, software organization, coding practices, and build setup\. All of these factors influence SAST tools and could potentially affect their usage\. In this experience paper, we report on a large\-scale empirical study of SAST in EMBOSS repositories\. We collected a corpus of 258 of the most popular EMBOSS projects, and then measured their use of SAST tools via program analysis and a survey \(N=25\) of their developers\. Advanced SAST tools are rarely used\-only 3% of projects go beyond trivial compiler analyses\. Developers cited the perception of ineffectiveness and false positives as reasons for limited adoption\. Motivated by this deficit, we applied the state\-of\-theart \(SOTA\) CodeQL SAST tool and measured its ease of use and actual effectiveness\. Across the 258 projects, CodeQL reported 709 true defects with a false positive rate of 34%\. There were 535 \(75%\) likely security vulnerabilities, including in major projects maintained by Microsoft, Amazon, and the Apache Foundation\. EMBOSS engineers have confirmed 376 \(53%\) of these defects, mainly by accepting our pull requests\. Two CVEs were issued\. Based on these results, we proposed pull requests to include our workflows as part of EMBOSS Continuous Integration \(CI\) pipelines, 37 \(71% of active repositories\) of these are already merged\. In summary, we urge EMBOSS engineers to adopt the current generation of SAST tools, which offer low false positive rates and are effective at finding security\-relevant defects\.
